# The Business of Life: Applying BI Tools & Techniques to Achieve Personal Goals

NW Missouri CSIC 44632 "Custom BI" Final Submission Project - Data Journal

- Author: Aaron Gillespie  
- Date: 2025-04-20

> [!NOTE]
> A somewhat tongue-in-cheek project utilizing business intelligence tools against **12 years of quantified self data** to determine, once and for all, what constitutes a successful life & build a dashboard to support it going forward. Compiled for fun, but also as part of Northwest Missouri's CSIS 44632 Final. 

This repository is being created in service of Northwest Missouri State University 44632 Module 7 - Exploratory Data Analysis. It will accomplish the following objectives from the module:

- demonstrate skills with Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn and popular tools for data analytics
- tell a data story and visually present findings in a clear and engaging manner

And, in my case, will include one additional objective:
- Utilizing my long-running quantified self project / data journal for an grad school assignment

## Section 1. The Business Goal

I am not a business, but I am a very goal-oriented person who's experienced in the way that businesses set and measure goals. I've my own Objectives and Key Results, I have my own Key Performance Indicators. I've built a system of tools supporting these goals, while also generally making note of events and happenings in my life. More on that later.

### My goals for 2025 are:

- To improve my health
  - leading indicators
    - move my bed & wake times toward 11:00pm and 7:00am
    - work out 183 times, balancing 1/2 strength, 1/3 cardio, & 1/6 mobility
    - eat out fewer than 156 times
    - drink fewer than 156 non-water/coffee/tea drinks
  - lagging indicators
    - improved results in [my generalized fitness test](https://aarongilly.com/Columns/379)
    - maintained or improved biometric test results (i.e. bloodwork)
    - fewer tracked `pains` & `treatments`
- To maintain my rate of content consumption
  - read 20 books
  - watch 36 (new) movies
  - play 3 (new) videogames
  - watch TV around 75 times
- To maintain my rate of content creation
  - write 18 [blog posts](https://aarongilly.com/467)
  - add 300 notes to [my public-facing body of notes](https://gillespedia.com)
  - record 12 [podcast episodes](https://shows.acast.com/we-scene-a-movie)
  - create 1 [puzzle box](https://aaronspuzzles.com)
- To partake in more of what gives life meaning
  - see friends 26 times
  - see family 26 times
  - go on 13 dates
  - see 4 concerts
  - do 13 fun outings of other types (e.g. bowling)

Not every single goal up there will be addressed in this project, but most of them will. I institute time-bound habits, personal rules, etc, and watch how they impact these numbers. In this way I learn what works and what doesn't. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> My ultimate goal is to try to live an interesting & satisfying life while providing for my family.

## Section 2. Data Source

Data are sourced from a variety of locations. The predominate sources are my [Data Journal](https://aarongilly.com/Pages/Data-Journal) and the data collected from my Oura Ring, but there are others, as illustrated below.

The data have been collected both actively and passively. Some data have **12 years** of history, while others started more recently.

## Section 3. Tools Used

Some portion of "tools used" is covered in my graphic above. The mechanics of the Data Journal are covered in the links provided above. The tools used in this project are as follows:

I will **not** be utilizing SQL, nor Spark, as in my experience for the volume of data I'll be working with *(on the order of 1000's of rows)* neither is required. 

## Section 4. Workflow & Logic

This is a required section, but I feel like it's pretty well covered by the above. 

What's not covered, perhaps, is the general approach in the Jupyter Notebook. The approach there is:

1. Read CSVs into Pandas DataFrames
2. Utilize Seaborn, Matlibplot, etc to generate visualizations
3. Tweak & caption visuals to tell the story
4. Close with an overall summary

## Section 5. Results (narrative + visualizations)



## Section 6. Suggested Business Action


## Section 7. Challenges


## Section 8. Ethical Considerations
